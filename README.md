## Roadmap

Currently maintaining on Trello, might move to Github later on.

## What's done till now?
- Added Building Blocks for Services - Serilog, Swagger, Fluent Validation, MediatR, AutoMapper, and more.
- ThunderClient Support for API Testing - Love this! üöÄ üöÄ
- YARP API Gateway - Reverse Proxy
- Identity Server 6 - Separate Microservice for serving and validating JWTs based on API Scope and GrantType as Password.
- DapR Integration - Currently using only the state-store component of Dapr for Caching purposes. Should research more on this. üöÄ üöÄ
- EFCore with PostgreSQL Integration for Identity Server.
- MongoDB Integration for Catalog API Service.
- GitHub Workflow for Building the Projects in Pipeline.
- Exception Handling Middleware
- Semantic Release - Love this! With this, it's easy now to auto-version your applications based on your commits in a semantic way. It even creates GitHub releases for you! üöÄ üöÄ
- Tye support for running multiple microservices (and Dapr Side-cars) and managing logs.

## How to Run

 Generate Development certificate by running the following:

 ```
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
dotnet dev-certs https -ep $env:USERPROFILE\.aspnet\https\dev_cert.pfx -p password!
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
 ```

### Docker-Compose

 Once the certificates are installed, you will have to build and push the required docker images to your local instance of docker, and run `docker-compose up`.

 Note that, the docker-compose, tye and any deployment related file would live within the `./deployments` folder.
 
 But first, let's build the docker images. There are 2 ways for this:
  - Navigate to each of the service, api-gateway & identity server and run the following command to build and push the docker image to your local docker-desktop setup.
  ```
  dotnet publish --os linux --arch x64 -c Release -p:PublishProfile=DefaultContainer -p:ContainerImageTags=latest --self-contained
  ```
- Else, to make your lives simpler, I have also included the commands in the Visual Code Tasks. Simply hit CTRL+SHIFT+P and type in Tasks. Here select the required publish:xxxxxx task. This would also push the docker image. 

Once all the images are built and pushed, you can run the following commands from the root of the solution. 

- If you want to bring up only the infrastructure, run this command `docker compose -f "./deployments/docker-compose/infrastructure.yml" up`
- To bring up both the services + infrastructure, `docker compose -f "./deployments/docker-compose/infrastructure.yml" -f "./deployments/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml" up`


If everything goes well, all the required containers would spin up and you will have access to https://localhost:5100 AKA, the API Gateway. You can use the Thunder-Tests in Visual Code to test the gateway! 

P.S, you find the API Tests at `./thunder-tests` folder. Ensure that you are using Visual Code with the ThunderClient extension installed.

### Tye

To run locally, you can also use the `tye` tool. I use this for rapid development. Simply run the `tye run` command at the `./deployments/tye/` directory. You can view all the application logs at the tye dashboard which is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000
## Contributing
